### Code for zipcode dataset (kd-tree for zipcode dataset.py)
Train data: train_data.csv
Test data: test_data1000.csv

libraries: time

Just run this code and wait for about 12 second to get the results



### Code for mnist dataset (kdtree for mnist.py)
Train data: data_mnist_train.mat
Test data: data_mnist_test.mat

libraries: scipy.io; numpy; heapq; time

The running time for the test dataset we make is too long(about 3 hours), so I comment that part and let the test data to be one test data point. Then just run the code for about 4 minutes to get the results.

When you run this, there might be several warning, you can just ignore that. (These warning won't affect the results) Then you can see the results between '######'.

And you can also change the 'one_test' in our code to check some other test point.
