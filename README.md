#### For kd-tree: 

All the related codes and dataset are in the folder: /EC504_Project/kd-tree

We used two dataset for comparing kd-tree and naive nn search, which are the zip code dataset and mnist dataset. Download the python code and the train_data and test_data, it will shows the difference between the naive NN method and using kd-tree in terms of accuracy and running time.

#### For LSH: 
we applied LSH algorithm for Mnist and AWA2 image data sets, which can be found in the floders: /EC504_Project/AWA and /EC504_Project/Mnist
